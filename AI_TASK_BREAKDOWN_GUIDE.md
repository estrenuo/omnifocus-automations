# AI Task Breakdown - Complete Guide

## Overview

The AI Task Breakdown plugin uses OpenAI GPT-5 to automatically break down complex tasks into actionable subtasks. It's perfect for tasks that feel overwhelming or unclear about where to start.

## How It Works

1. **Select tasks** you want to break down (1-5 tasks)
2. **Run the plugin** from Automation menu
3. **AI analyzes** each task and determines logical steps
4. **Subtasks are created** automatically (2-10 per task)
5. **Tagged** with "AI: Suggested" for easy filtering
6. **Parent task updated** with breakdown note

## Features

### Intelligent Breakdown
- ✅ AI determines optimal number of steps (2-10)
- ✅ Includes preparation, execution, and verification steps
- ✅ Considers dependencies and prerequisites
- ✅ Creates specific, actionable subtasks

### Seamless Integration
- ✅ Subtasks created as children of parent task
- ✅ Tagged with "AI: Suggested" for filtering
- ✅ Parent task gets breakdown note
- ✅ Preserves existing task structure

### Smart & Fast
- ✅ Processes 1-5 tasks at once
- ✅ 30-60 second response time
- ✅ Comprehensive debug logging
- ✅ Built-in credential management

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

**Step 1: Select Tasks**
```
Select 1-5 tasks that need breaking down
Example: "Launch new website"
```

**Step 2: Run Plugin**
```
Automation menu → AI Task Breakdown

```

**Step 3: Wait for AI**
```
Progress message shows: "Breaking Down Tasks..."
Wait 30-60 seconds for GPT-5
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Select Appropriate Tasks

**Good candidates:**
- Complex tasks with multiple steps
- Tasks you're procrastinating on
- Tasks where you're unsure where to start
- Projects that need planning

**Not ideal:**
- Already simple tasks ("Call John")
- Tasks with obvious single action
- Tasks that are already broken down

### 2. Start Small

**First time:**
- Select 1-2 tasks
- Review AI suggestions
- Get comfortable with the workflow

**Regular use:**
- Process 3-5 tasks at a time
- Batch similar tasks together

### 3. Review and Customize

**AI suggestions are starting points:**
- Reorder subtasks if needed
- Edit names to match your style
- Add or remove steps
- Combine similar steps

**Don't blindly accept:**
- AI might miss context you have
- Some steps might not apply to you
- Adjust to your workflow

### 4. Use Tags Effectively

**"AI: Suggested" tag:**
- Filter to see all AI-generated subtasks
- Review before starting work
- Remove tag after reviewing/editing
- Keep tag if you want to track AI suggestions

### 5. Combine with Other Plugins

**Workflow:**
1. Use **AI Task Breakdown** to create subtasks
2. Use **AI Task Clarifier** to improve subtask clarity
3. Process both sets of suggestions

## Advanced Usage

### Create Perspectives

**"AI Suggested Tasks"**
```
Filter: Tag is "AI: Suggested"
Group by: Project
Sort by: Creation date
```

**"Tasks to Break Down"**
```
Filter: 
  - No children (no subtasks)
  - Not tagged "AI: Suggested"
  - Estimated duration > 30 minutes
```

### Batch Processing

**Weekly Planning:**
```
1. Review upcoming tasks
2. Select 5 complex tasks
3. Run AI Task Breakdown
4. Review all subtasks
5. Adjust and organize
6. Remove "AI: Suggested" tags
```

### Integration with Reviews

**Weekly Review Checklist:**
```
☐ Review completed tasks
☐ Identify complex upcoming tasks
☐ Run AI Task Breakdown on 3-5 tasks
☐ Review and adjust subtasks
☐ Set priorities for next week
```

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Provide Context in Task Name

**Better results with context:**
```
❌ "Website"
✅ "Launch new marketing website"

❌ "Meeting"
✅ "Prepare Q4 board meeting presentation"

❌ "Project"
✅ "Complete customer onboarding redesign project"
```

### 2. Use Task Notes

**AI considers notes:**
```
Task: "Plan conference"
Note: "Annual developer conference, 500 attendees, 
       3-day event, need venue, speakers, catering"

AI will create more specific subtasks based on this context
```

### 3. Iterate if Needed

**If breakdown isn't helpful:**
1. Delete the subtasks
2. Add more context to parent task
3. Run plugin again
4. Compare results

### 4. Combine Manual and AI

**Hybrid approach:**
1. Let AI create initial breakdown
2. Add your own subtasks
3. Reorder to match your workflow
4. Best of both worlds!

### 5. Learn from AI

**Improve your planning:**
- Notice what steps AI includes
- Learn to think in smaller steps
- Apply patterns to future tasks
- Become better at task breakdown

## Troubleshooting

### "No Tasks Selected"

**Problem:** Plugin requires task selection

**Solution:** Select 1-5 tasks before running

### "Request timed out"

**Problem:** Too many tasks or slow response

**Solutions:**
- Select fewer tasks (1-3)
- Try again (network issue)
- Check internet connection

### Subtasks too generic

**Problem:** AI doesn't have enough context

**Solutions:**
- Add more detail to task name
- Add context in task note
- Edit subtasks after creation

### Too many/few subtasks

**Problem:** AI's judgment doesn't match yours

**Solutions:**
- Delete unnecessary subtasks
- Add missing subtasks manually
- Combine similar subtasks
- AI aims for 2-10, adjust as needed

### Subtasks in wrong order

**Problem:** AI's order doesn't match your workflow

**Solution:** Reorder subtasks in OmniFocus (drag and drop)

## Comparison with Manual Breakdown

### Manual Breakdown
**Pros:**
- Complete control
- Matches your exact workflow
- No API costs

**Cons:**
- Time-consuming
- Easy to miss steps
- Requires mental effort
- Procrastination risk

### AI Breakdown
**Pros:**
- Fast (30-60 seconds)
- Comprehensive (rarely misses steps)
- Reduces mental load
- Helps overcome procrastination

**Cons:**
- Requires review/editing
- May include unnecessary steps
- API costs (~$0.01-0.02 per task)
- Needs internet connection
